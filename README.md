# ChangeFileDate

This is a simple program that allows for changing the creation time, last write time, and last access time for a given file. This is, more than anything, just to showcase how trivially easy it is to manipulate the date information for a file. This data can be changed in a single line of code, and so should always be taken with a grain of salt.
